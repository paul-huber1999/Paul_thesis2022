# MySmallJavaProject
 
# the project contains a main class 'SimpleMain' from which the program can be executed

# the data set of hypernymy relations from WebIsA is not included in this repository due to the size of it (100GB)
# the data can be downloaded at http://webdatacommons.org/isadb/index.html
# the input file path of the directory needs to be added to the class 'Constants' in the package 'Utilities'
# directories for output, reflexive (excluded relations) and reversed relations need to be created and respective file paths added to the 'Constants' class
